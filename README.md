# Integrated Design Research Methods

## Course Description

Design Research Methods is a graduate level course to provide students philosophical and societal context for science and design and to take students through the research process. This includes learning about the philosophy of science, falsification, the design process, and quantitative and qualitative research methods.

## Topics

- evaluating sources
- peer review process
- typical structure of a scientific manuscript
- citations

### Statistics

Goal is be able to read and interpret articles that present statistical data and statistical tests.

Conduct descriptive analysis of data.

Descriptive statistics: 
  - measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
  - variabilty, standard deviation, skewnesss
  - distributions, percentiles
  - plots (including box-plots)
  - correlation

Inferential statistics (examine whether observations are reliably different compared to chance):
  - 2 types: parametric (assumed normal distributions) and non-parametric
  - T-test (parametric test between 2 groups)
  - Analysis of Variance (parametric test between 2 or more groups)
