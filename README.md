# Integrated Design Research Methods

## Course Description

Design Research Methods is a graduate level course to provide students philosophical and societal context for science and design and to take students through the research process. This includes learning about the philosophy of science, falsification, the design process, and quantitative and qualitative research methods.

## Topics

### Philosophy of Science

What is science?
- method of inquiry to obtain knowledge

What are the tenets of science?
- empirical
- rational
- testable
- parsimonous
- generalizable
- tentative
- rigorous

What is the scientific method?
- experimental vs. non-experimental studies
- covariation is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for causality

Falsification (Popper)

### Design

What is the design process?

Integrated design

### Statistics

Descriptive statistics: 
  - measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
  - variabilty, standard deviation, skewnesss
  - distributions, percentiles
  - box-plots

Inferential statistics (examine whether observations are reliably different compared to chance):
  - 2 types: parametric (assumed normal distributions) and non-parametric
  - T-test (parametric test between 2 groups)
  - Analysis of Variance (parametric test between 2 or more groups)

### Scientific writing

- evaluating sources
- peer review
- typical structure of a scientific manuscript
- citations
